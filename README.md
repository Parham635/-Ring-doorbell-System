# Facial Recognition Door Lock with Arduino

This project combines facial detection using OpenCV with Arduino-based door lock activation. The system detects faces through a webcam, and when a face is detected, it triggers the Arduino script that activates the door lock.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Arduino board and IDE
- Arduino-compatible stepper motor
- Webcam

## Setup

1. Install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python
